# Tuan Vo

Hey Tuan here, born in Canada in the year 2006 and a current undergrad CS student.

## Hobbies (not in order)

1. Gaming
   - The Finals
   - Warframe
   - Spin Rhythm XD
   - Deep Rock Galatic

2. Balisong Flipping
   - I own a BBsuperfly Cuda Series Trainer (Not a sharp blade and unsharpenable), so its just a extremely expensive fidget toy...
  
3. Origami
   - I am by all means not a expert at origami nor can make original creations, but I enjoy folding challenging designs
   - Currently the most challenging one I can make is Jo Nakashima's Origami Eagle
