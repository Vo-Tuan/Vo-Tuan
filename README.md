# Tuan Vo

Hey Tuan here, born in Canada in the year 2006 and a current undergrad CS student.

## Hobbies (not in order)

- Gaming
   - I mainly play FPS's but I am a mix player
   - Current Games:
      - The Finals
      - Warframe
      - Spin Rhythm XD
      - Deep Rock Galatic
        

- Balisong Flipping
   - I own a BBsuperfly Cuda Series Trainer (Not a sharp blade and unsharpenable), so its just a extremely expensive fidget toy...

  
- Origami
   - I am by all means not a expert at origami nor can make original creations, but I enjoy folding challenging designs
   - Currently the most challenging one I can make is Jo Nakashima's Origami Eagle
